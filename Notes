DAY1

  OSI model 
    1. physical - hardware specifications, on/off switch, transmission/reception, encoding/signaling
    2. data link - where layer 1 devices communicate, uses MAC address, LLC
    3. network - (IP), headers basically. offsets n such
    4. transport - tcp/udp, 3-way handshake 
    5. session - maintatins connection,  
    6. presentation - translation, formatting, encoding, encryption, compression
    7. appllication - FTP, active/passive
  Stuff & Things 
    ssh - client/server authentication, symmetric session. data stream channeling, user/host - asymmetric
    sudo tcpdump "ether[12:2] = 0x800" -d *** berkeley packet fitler for something idk
    sudo tcpdump "tcp[13] & 0x01 = 0x01" *** packets with fin flag set
    i dont know what is going on fr
    
    switch - only destination MAC, fragment free - first 64 bytes, layer 2
          switch1#show mac address-table
          
    spanning tree protocol (STP) - elects root bridge, identifies root ports on non-root bridge, 
                                    and desig. port for each segment, alt ports to blocking state
    
    CDP - layer 2 discovery protocol
    Port security 0 shutdown, restrict, protect
    
    arpbroadcast=Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")/ARP(op=1, pdst="172.16.82.115")
    arpspoofed=ARP(op=2, psrc="172.16.82.126", pdst="172.16.82.115", hwdst="fa:16:3e:24:20:44")
